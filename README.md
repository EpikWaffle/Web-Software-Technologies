Homework for my Web Software Technologies class

This is all the work I have done for my Web技术 (Web Software Technologies) class I am currently enrolled in at Peking University. 

The class had an apache server setup for us to work on. Because a VPN is so necessary to living in China and I couldn't connect to the server with my VPN on, I would sometimes do the work locally and then upload it to the apache server and make any required changes. I, unfortunately, broke my apache server a little bit while trying to do a clean reinstallation of apache because my php installation kept failing. I forgot to turn the apache server off first before doing the reinstallation and as a result, the server is still up but I can no longer stop/start it. On top of that, whenever I tried to run a perl script, the page would instead say "Forbidden. You don't have permission to access this resource." After installing Python and setting up Django, I managed to break everything and now my entire website has that error on every page. 

So, instead I have decided to upload that code here and continue to work on my website locally which is also here. "y2019g28" is the folder with the apache code. "local" is the folder with all of my local files.
