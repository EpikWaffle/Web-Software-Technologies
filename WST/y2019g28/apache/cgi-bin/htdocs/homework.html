    <h3>For the three categories of web software technology we've just defined, you are asked to find out which category so-called "Chrome plug-in" technology belongs to. Please describe the basic idea of the technology, and give your reasoning on its position in the technology categories.</h3>
    <p>
        A Google Chrome plug-in would fall under productivity and quality-oriented technology. This category of WSTs are focused on creating quality web services more effectively. Essentially, they are not technically necessary for a website but improve the user experience of one greatly. An example is JavaScript which isn't necessary for building a website but can help make a website feel smoother. In a similar manner, a Google Chrome plug-in is not necessary at all to browse the internet. However, plug-ins are used to enhance browsing the internet. For example, I use plug-ins that act as dictionaries for Chinese characters and Japanese characters. They help me learn both languages and help me access information that would otherwise be lost on me. However, they are not necessary in terms of me being able to access a website.

    <h3>In a normal intercommunication between Web browser and Web Server, Web Server closes the network communication right after it sends back the document requested by the browser. Think about this statusless character of World Wide Web. Give some good points and bad points of it. Can a web server know exactly how many browsers are reading its document?</h3>
    <p>
        The stateless protocol that is the foundation of the World Wide Web means that there is no information that is retained by the Web Server. This is useful because every request is easily identifiable. The server doesn't need to dynamically update how much memory to allocate. This makes hosting a server not only simpler, but cheaper. A disadvantage is that it makes browsing the internet less convenient. Hence, cookies were created. Having a website remember you so you don't have to log in everytime is a convenience most people enjoy. However, cookies is more of a workaround to how our internet is currently set up. A stateful protocol would likely be more efficient than cookies. 
        <br>
        A web server can't know how many browsers are currently reading its document. It can tally how many browsers have read its document in a given time. But, because the connection is closed immediately after it sends the document, a web server will not know when a browser has exited out of the document. Thus, it's impossible to tell how many browsers are reading at a given time. You can only tell how many browsers have read over the course of a period of time.

    <h3>Open Question: of those client side technologies, why Java Applet is getting dead and Javascript success? Try to explain from the "REST" perspective.</h3>

        This question is optional. I might come back to answer it.

		The major difference between a CGI program and a PHP program is that CGI programs has to run for every page request and sends the entire response back, including all the HTTP headers and everything. This makes it overall much more costly and slow compared to PHP which was made specifically with HTML in mind. It can handle these requests and store data much more efficiently.

	1. Browser sniffing is the act of detecting the web browser someone is using to visit the website. In this case, they are written in Javascript, hence Javascript Browser Sniffer.
	</br>
	2. They are used commonly in Javascript because browser support of Javascript is inconsistent. This means certain browsers support different versions of Javascript. If you make a website that is incompatible with a certain browser, it can be useful to use a browser sniffer to let any users on that browser know that the website won't function normally.
